                <h2><b><strong>V60.</strong></b></h2>
                <p style=" position: relative;"></p>The V60 Dripper was designed by the Japanese company Hario. It was
                founded in Tokyo in 1921, with a focus on producing and selling environmentally friendly glass products,
                utilising 100% natural minerals. The rise of coffee culture in Japan saw them create their first coffee
                product, a filter coffee syphon, in 1949. The V60 is a relatively new concept and design only hitting
                the market around 15 years ago.

                The name stems from ‘vector 60’ due to the 60º angle of the cone, and it can now be purchased in
                ceramic, glass, plastic and even metal. The V60 enables you to brew speciality roasted coffee in your
                home with ease, producing lovely sediment-free coffee. The process is extremely straight forward, and
                due to a design focus on heat retention, this enhances the brewing extraction process, which has led to
                it becoming the brewing method choice of many speciality coffee drinkers in the UK and the world.

                            <p style=" position: relative;"></p>An Aeropress is a compact coffee maker invented by Alan
                            Adler in 2005. Made from BPA-free plastic, it has three main components: a brewing chamber,
                            a plunger, and a filter cap. Plus it comes with accessories, including a coffee scoop,
                            funnel, stirrer, paper filters, and a filter holder. The Aeropress coffee maker is
                            lightweight, durable, and doesn’t require electricity, so it is popular for travel and
                            camping. With only a 10-ounce brewing capacity, it is typically considered a single-serve
                            brewer. However, it is possible to brew very strong coffee that can be diluted into multiple
                            cups.

                            <p style=" position: relative;"></p>It was back in 1941 when a German chemist, Peter J.
                            Schlumbohm, invented this brewing device.

                            He combined a laboratory glass funnel and an Erlenmeyer flask still widely used in
                            laboratories.

                            In this combination, an air funnel was needed to make a space for the air escaping when
                            water was poured in. This funnel is up in the front of the device.

                            Also, to save hands from the heat, he added a wooden belt to the waist of Chemex.

                            <p style=" position: relative;"></p>Cold-brewed coffee, or cold brew, is coffee made by
                            steeping ground coffee in room-temperature water for several hours, usually 12 to 18 hours
                            or even longer, then straining out the grounds and chilling it before serving it either
                            as-is, over ice, or diluted with water.

                            Cold brewing extracts the flavor along with the caffeine from the coffee beans, producing a
                            rich, flavorful, and stimulating brew. As with conventional coffee, milk, cream, and/or
                            sugar are frequent add-ins with cold brew as well.

                            Cold brew aficionados say that the flavor of cold brew is much smoother and milder and
                            lacking in the acidic quality of ordinary brewed coffee. This is because cool water doesn't
                            bring about the chemical changes that produce the acidity as well as the bitter flavor
                            associated with hot coffee.
